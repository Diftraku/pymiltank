# PyMiltank
A Python port of https://github.com/dfrankland/pokemonsay with minimal dependencies.

This project aims to provide tools to convert existing assets into cowsay templates. Instead of cloning cowsay, why not just assimilate it with Pokemon instead?

# Getting sprites
You can grab sprites from the original inspiration ([pokesay](https://github.com/dfrankland/pokemonsay)) or from the [Veekun Pokedex's media repository](http://git.veekun.com/pokedex-media.git)
